# General

_Rick Waldron:_
> "All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed."

_Idan Gazit:_
> "If thousands of people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity."

_Unix:_
> "Keep it Simple, Stupid."

These are the fundamental principals we follow when we design and develop software.
